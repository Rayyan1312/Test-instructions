# Test-instructionsGoal

Create a tool that uses a multimodal LLM to describe testing instructions for any

digital product's features, based on the screenshots.

What You Need to Build

Front-end:

A simple web page with the following inputs:

- A text box for optional context.

- A multi-image uploader for screenshots (required).

- A button 'Describe Testing Instructions'.

Back-end:

- Integrate a multimodal LLM to process the screenshots and optional text

context.

- Output should describe a detailed, step-by-step guide on how to test each

functionality. Each test case should include:

- Description: What the test case is about.

- Pre-conditions: What needs to be set up or ensured before testing.

- Testing Steps: Clear, step-by-step instructions on how to perform

the test.

- Expected Result: What should happen if the feature works correctly.
